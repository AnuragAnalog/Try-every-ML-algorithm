# Try every ML algorithm

We as a Data Scientist are very lazy in trying out every different algorithm on a given dataset.

This web interface provides you a convinent way of switching between algorithms are seeing there results.

With this now, you can apply machine learning models without writing a Single Piece of code.

## Required Modules

* Pandas
* Streamlit
* Scikit-learn
